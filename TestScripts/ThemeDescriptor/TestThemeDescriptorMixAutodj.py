'''
	Visualizes the theme descriptor progression of a generated DJ mix.
	The theme descriptors of the successive songs are read from the xtestfile.csv file, which has been saved during generation.
	
	Usage:
		python TestThemeDescriptorMixAutodj.py ../music ../moremusic ../evenmoremusic ../music/test
		
	The files xtestfile.csv and xtestfile_goals.csv must be in the working directory.
	This file needs to be in the autodj/Applications folder to work, as it uses e.g. the Song and SongCollection class
