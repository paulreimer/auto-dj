	This script evaluates all possible overlappings of songs that have been manually annotated with singing voice annotations.
	It creates a confusion matrix of two classes: either the overlap clashes in vocals, or the overlap does not clash in vocals.
	Several methods of smoothing the classifier output and estimating whether overlaps are conflicting are evaluated.
	
	On the ground truth annotations, an overlap is considered clashing if the number of downbeats that simultaneously have vocals is more than 4
	
	On the predicted results, several things have been tried:
	- median filtering of the output, kernel = 3
	[[23263  4027]
	 [ 1321  3166]]
	[[ 0.85243679  0.14756321]
	 [ 0.29440606  0.70559394]]

	- median filtering of the output, kernel = 5
	[[25033  2257]
	 [ 1856  2631]]
	[[ 0.91729571  0.08270429]
	 [ 0.4136394   0.5863606 ]]
	 
	- iterating over all 4-downbeat length segments of the overlap with hop size 2:
	a 4-downbeat segment is considered vocal if there are more than 2 downbeats in it with (estimated) vocal activity
	a clash occurs if two vocal 4-downbeat segments of both songs overlap
	[[22780  4510]
	 [ 1267  3220]]
	[[ 0.834738    0.165262  ]
	 [ 0.28237129  0.71762871]]
	
	- "low-pass" filtering the predictions as: a[i] = (a[i-1] + a[i+1] + 2*a[i]) >= 2
	an element in a_new is true if the corresponding element in a is true, or if both neighbors are true
	a clash occurs occurs if two downbeat segments of these smoothed results overlap
	
	Mean length of clash relative to crossfade length if incorrectly detected: 0.218728343728
	(so if there is an undetected vocal clash, about 1/5th of the crossfade contains clashing vocals)
	
	>= 4 ground truth
